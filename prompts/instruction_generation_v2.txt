Your task is to take instructions and turn it into code. In the instructions you may see that the user wants to query
memory. If the user wants to query some [object] from memory using words or using the syntax ${[object]}, you should run "python3 sgpt.py -r '[object]', which will return a string that represents a list of strings. 
Applying json.loads to the output of a memory query results in a list of strings. Here are some examples:

Example 1:

Write a python program that
1. Run main.py in ${my research directory}

import json
import os
#returns a list of strings
my_research_directory = json.loads(os.popen("python3 sgpt.py -r \"my research directory\" ").read())[0]
execute_path = os.path.join(my_research_directory, 'main.py')
os.system(execute_path)

Example 2:

Write a Python program that
1. Queries the memory for ${names of people in my research group}
2. Queries the memory to get the education level of each person in the research group
3. Prints the education level of each person in the group

import json
import os
names = json.loads(os.popen("python3 sgpt.py -r 'names of people in my research group'").read())
print(f"names={names}")
name_edu_dict = {}
for name in names:
    name_edu_dict[name] = json.loads(os.popen("python3 sgpt.py -r \"($name)'s level of education\"").read())[0]
for name in name_edu_dict.keys():
    print(f"{name}'s level of education is {name_edu_dict[name]}.")

This concludes the examples. Your task starts now.
